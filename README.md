# 👋 Hey, I'm **Luka Turunen** — Full-Stack Blockchain Engineer  
*I design and build complete Web3 products — from smart contracts to modern, production-grade frontends.*

---

## About Me

I'm a 17-year-old full-stack blockchain engineer specializing in **smart contract development**, **DeFi protocol architecture**, and **full Web3 application engineering**.  
I build complete, real-world blockchain products from scratch: smart contracts → tests → deployment → frontend → UX.

I focus heavily on:

- **DeFi protocol design** (AMMs, staking systems, tokenomics)  
- **Smart contract engineering** with Solidity, Foundry, and Hardhat  
- **Secure contract development** using modern patterns and testing  
- **Frontend Web3 engineering** using React, Viem, and Wagmi  
- **Protocol-level problem solving** and end-to-end architecture  

My projects aren’t tutorials — they’re **actual products**, built with production structure and real engineering standards.

I enjoy working on systems that combine economics, cryptography, and software engineering into something powerful and elegant.

## What I Do

### Smart Contract Engineering
- Solidity development (ERC-20, ERC-721, AMMs, staking contracts, whitelisting, tokenomics)  
- Contract architecture and state machine design  
- Auditable patterns: reentrancy protection, access control, modifiers  
- Gas-optimized, modular, readable code  
- Full testing workflows with **Foundry** (unit tests, fuzzing, edge cases)

### DeFi Protocol Development
- Constant-product AMMs (`x * y = k`)  
- LP token mint/burn mechanics  
- Flexible and time-locked staking vaults  
- Reward accounting and APR logic  
- Slippage protection and pricing formulas  
- Multi-contract protocol architecture  

### Full-Stack Web3 Applications
- Modern React frontends with **Vite**  
- Web3 integrations via **Wagmi v2**, **Viem**, and **RainbowKit**  
- Real-time on-chain data and analytics dashboards  
- Transaction flows, wallet UX, and event-driven updates  
- Clean, responsive UI with **Tailwind CSS** and **Framer Motion**

### Blockchain Tooling & Infrastructure
- Hardhat and Foundry development pipelines  
- Deployment scripts and network configuration  
- Contract verification and ABI management  
- IPFS integration for NFT metadata

## Engineering Philosophy

I build blockchain software with a strong focus on:

- **Security first** — testing, invariants, access control  
- **Clear architecture** — maintainable and readable systems  
- **Correct math** — deterministic pricing and reward accounting  
- **User experience** — Web3 apps that feel fast and reliable  
- **End-to-end ownership** — from idea to deployment  

My goal is to create systems that are **robust, transparent, and enjoyable to use**.

## Featured Projects

### **CharonSwap — DeFi Ecosystem (AMM + Staking)**
A complete protocol featuring a Uniswap-style AMM, staking vaults, custom ERC-20 tokens, faucet system, and a full analytics-enabled frontend.  
Built with Solidity, Foundry, Hardhat, and a modern React Web3 stack.

### **CharonNFT — NFT Minting & Marketplace**
An end-to-end ERC-721 platform with whitelist minting, IPFS metadata pipeline, NFT gallery, and a full secondary marketplace UI.  
Includes on-chain metadata handling, marketplace logic, and polished UX.

_All projects are deployed on Ethereum Sepolia testnet._

## What I'm Currently Working On
- Advanced DeFi primitives and protocol design  
- Improving smart contract auditing workflows (fuzzing, invariants)  
- More scalable multi-contract architectures  
- Higher-polish, production-grade Web3 frontends

## Final Note

I learn by **building**, pushing myself into increasingly complex blockchain systems, and refining my engineering approach with each project.

Open to collaboration, hiring opportunities, and technical discussions.
